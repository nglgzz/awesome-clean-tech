# Contributing Guidelines

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search existing companies before adding a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Entries in the Companies section should use the following format:

```
- [Company Name](URL) | Based in | Founded Year

Short description.
```

- If you can't find the year the company was founded in put `-` instead.
- The company should be put into its appropriate category. Pick the one you think is closest if you are not sure. If no category is appropriate, feel free to create a new category.
- Sort the companies inside a category in alphabetical order.
- Only add companies you think are awesome.
- Start the description with a capital letter and end with a full stop.
- Don't start the description with A or An.
- Keep the description simple, don't use buzzwords or meaningless words, just explain what problem the company is trying to solve and how, like you would explain to a friend.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization or descriptions are welcome.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
