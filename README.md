### Vegetation, Agriculture & Food

- [Droneseed](https://www.droneseed.co/) | Seattle, USA | 2015

  Their mission is to reforest the world’s 2 billion hectares of degraded land.

- [Olio](https://olioex.com/) | UK | 2015

  Mobile app for food-sharing, aiming to reduce food waste. It does this by connecting those with surplus food to those who need or wish to consume such food. The food must be edible; it can be raw or cooked, sealed or open.

- [Phytoponics](https://phytoponics.com/) | UK | 2016

  Produces a commercial scale hydroponic growing system, which is cheaper and easier to install and maintain than traditional hydroponic systems. The goal is to bring the benefits of hydroponics (less water and land, more consistent yields), with a lower investment up front.

- [Solar Foods](https://solarfoods.fi/) | Finland | 2017

  Produces Solein - a single-cell protein - from water, CO2 and electricity. It doesn’t require arable land or irrigation and isn’t limited by climate conditions. The original concept of Solein was born from a NASA space programme, and was further developed in the research projects of the Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd and the Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT).

- [Too Good To Go](https://toogoodtogo.com/en) | France | 2016

  Gives the possibility for restaurants, stores, bakeries and cafés to sell unsold food at the end of the day. Since it is impossible to know in advance what will be the unsolds of the day, the users get a "surprise basket" of about 500g of food. Pretty much like Karma, but more present in France.

- [Vultus](https://www.vultus.se/) | Sweden | 2016

  Uses satellite imaging to save fertilizer usage up to 30%, and track crops health. This allows farmers to reduce their Nitrous Oxide emissions, a greenhouse gas that is 298 times more potent than CO2.

### Materials

- [Cellugy](https://cellugy.com/) | Denmark | 2018

  Offers a biomaterial produced from food and vegetable waste, that can be used for packaging as an alternative to plastic. This material is translucent, resistent, and home compostable.

- [Organicbasics](https://organicbasics.com) | Denmark | 2015

  Offers underwear, essentials and activewear made consciously in Europe. The material used for their production is natural, renewable,recycled, biodegradable and or low-impact textiles only.

### Water

- [The Ocean Cleanup](https://theoceancleanup.com/) | Netherlands | 2013

  Developed a technology to passively collect ocean debris, with the goal of cleaning the oceans of 90% of their plastic waste by 2040. In 2018 they deployed their solution in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.

- [Orbital Systems](https://orbital-systems.com/) | Sweden | 2012

  Collaborated with NASA to develop a shower system that uses 90% less water. The shower has a purification system that makes it possible to reuse the same batch of water. The company now wants to make this technology - initially developed for space - available to consumers.

- [Solar Water Solutions](https://solarwatersolutions.fi/en/) | Finland | -

  Develops a reverse osmosis technology for producing drinking water with low operating expenses and no CO2 emissions. The desalination system is fully solar, independent of external energy sources and easy-to-use and maintain.

### Energy
