### Agriculture & Food

- [Impossible Foods](https://impossiblefoods.com/) | California, USA | 2011

  Their plant based burgers require 96% less land, 87% less water, and 89% less greenhouse emissions to produce than traditional burgers. Their mission is to produce plant based meat in order to reduce the impact of the meat industry on the environment.

- [Phytoponics](https://phytoponics.com/) | UK | 2016

  Produces a commercial scale hydroponic growing system, which is cheaper and easier to install and maintain than traditional hydroponic systems. The goal is to bring the benefits of hydroponics (less water and land, more consistent yields), with a lower investment up front.

- [Solar Foods](https://solarfoods.fi/) | Finland | 2017

  Produces Solein - a single-cell protein - from water, CO2 and electricity. It doesn’t require arable land or irrigation and isn’t limited by climate conditions. The original concept of Solein was born from a NASA space programme, and was further developed in the research projects of the Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd and the Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT).

- [Vultus](https://www.vultus.se/) | Sweden | 2016

  Uses satellite imaging to save fertilizer usage up to 30%, and track crops healt. This allows farmers to reduce their Nitrous Oxide emissions, a greenhouse gas that is 298 times more potent than CO2.

### Materials

- [Cellugy](https://cellugy.com/) | Denmark | 2018

  Offers a biomaterial produced from food and vegetable waste, that can be used for packaging as an alternative to plastic. This material is translucent, resistent, and home compostable.

### Water

- [The Ocean Cleanup](https://theoceancleanup.com/) | Netherlands | 2013

- [Orbital Systems](https://orbital-systems.com/) | Sweden | 2012

  Collaborated with NASA to develop a shower system that uses 90% less water. The shower has a purification system that makes it possible to reuse the same batch of water. The company now wants to make this technology - initially developed for space - available to consumers.

- [Solar Water Solutions](https://solarwatersolutions.fi/en/) | Finland | -

  Develops a reverse osmosis technology for producing drinking water with low operating expenses and no CO2 emissions. The desalination system is fully solar, independent of external energy sources and easy-to-use and maintain.

### Energy

- [Nel ASA](https://nelhydrogen.com/) | Norway | 1927

  Provides solutions for the production, storage and distribution of hydrogen from renewable energy sources.

- [Solar City](https://www.tesla.com/solarpanels) | California, USA | 2006
